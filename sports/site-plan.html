      <p>
        This site is a faster way to look at all teams and teams in their respective states. This is done by showing each team from the NFL, NBA, MLB, and NHL. Every team across major sports will be shown in categories such as states and their own respected sport. For example, The NFL will page will show the Chiefs, Falcons, Vikings, etcâ€¦ But the state page will have just the teams. For example, Kansas City has the Chiefs for the NFL. This is why this site will be visited by others. Instead of manually looking for the info throughout other websites. This site will answer the questions of nearby sports teams and teams around their area. There are states with no teams like Montana and Wyoming, and it may be difficult to find a team that is close by. This site will answer those questions with teams close by. This site is more for research purposes and to have fun with friends/family. It is a site with all information already typed out in one spot. In order to navigate across the site, you must know the basics of technology. And being able to navigate between links. This is a very fun way to find info and apply it. This can be a life alteration depending on how much of a sports fan you are. For instance, you can make new friends and possibly loved ones with your favorite teams or sports in general.
